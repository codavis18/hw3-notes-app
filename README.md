## What I did
I made a simple note-taking/post-it/stickies app using react. The app has 3 components: 
- the app container
- the note component
- the note bar (where you type in to create a note)

## What worked / didnâ€™t work
- markdown display
- autosized notes

## Extra credit
- used react-bootstrap to make note creator bar look better 
- made notes look pretty
